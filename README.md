# Breast-Cancer-Classification

**Breast cancer:**  <br />
Breast cancer is a kind of cancer that begins with the growth of cells in the breast tissue. After skin cancer, breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in women in the United States. But breast cancer doesn't just happen in women. Everyone is born with some breast tissue, so anyone can get breast cancer. Breast cancer survival rates have been increasing. And the number of people dying of breast cancer is steadily going down. Much of this is due to the widespread support for breast cancer awareness and funding for research.  <br />

Signs of breast cancer may include a lump in the breast, a change in breast shape, dimpling of the skin, milk rejection, fluid coming from the nipple, a newly inverted nipple, or a red or scaly patch of skin. In those with a distant spread of the disease, there may be bone pain, swollen lymph nodes, shortness of breath, or yellow skin.

***Types Of Tumor We Are Working On-*** <br />
Benign and Malignant 

-**About Dataset:** <br />
![Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data) <br />
Features are computed from a digitised image of a breast mass's fine needle aspirate (FNA). They describe the characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. <br />
Attribute Information:
1) ID number
2) Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)
3-32)
Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:
a) radius (mean of distances from the centre to points on the perimeter)
b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
c) perimeter
d) area
e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
g) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
h) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
i) symmetry
j) fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)
The mean, standard error and "worst" or largest (mean of the three
largest values) of these features were computed for each image, resulting in 30 features. For instance, field 3 is the Mean Radius, field 13 is the Radius SE, and field 23 is the Worst Radius. All feature values are recorded with four significant digits. Missing attribute values: none. Class distribution: 357 benign, 212 malignant
